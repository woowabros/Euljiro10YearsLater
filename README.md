# Euljiro 10 Years Later
'Euljiro 10 Years Laterâ€™ was created by imagining 'BM Euljiro font' 10 years later. The traces of sunlight and rainstorms accumulated over a period of 10 years are embedded in the font. (More worn-out characters are available in programs that support contextual alternates functions).
